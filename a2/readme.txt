Within A2 I have implemented the following successfully:
Criteria: 1, 2, 6-14

Multiple hierarchical objects composed of at least two levels present 
from line 526 to line 1003
At least two textures mapped:
	Ground texture Lines 531-534
	Punching Bag texture Lines: 600-602
	Texture for Monkey model Lines: 555-557
	Note: All textures within A2 are provided by www.opengameart.org and are open domain products
	without any copyrights.
Camera fly around performed upon animation flag Lines: 519-522
Connection to real time: Camera fly around synced to real time and movement of the models synced to 
animation flag allowing for movement to emulate real time speed
Frame rate every 2 seconds displayed in graphics window, present in main.js lines: 508-516 and
main.html lines 110-111.
Criteria 9-14 To be evaluated by the TA marking the assessment, I do not know if my scene is up to
the standard of animation expected for this assignment, however, I had a lot of fun creating the models
and hope that the marking TA enjoys my monkey hitting a punching bag.

Missing/Partially implemented criteria:
Criteria 3-5
The shaders portion of the criteria was quite confusing to be honest. I attempted to shift the main.html 
shader script from Phong to a Blinn-Phong model by introducing the H vertex, however, I do not know how 
to go about implementing such a change in the fragment shader therefore I believe my code lacks 
significantly in that regard.
