# CSC 305
The files within this Repository pertains to my computer science 305: Introduction to Graphics course. 
Each file contains a readme which describes the project itself, the parameters that I had the time to implement and the parameters that I did not.
# Developers note:
I want to show the unedited work that I have completed for the course to acknowledge what I can do in a limited
time frame. These projects each recieved B grades and were some of the most fun assignments I have ever done.
# A1
Assignment A1 was the introductory assignment in WebGL with HTML and Javascript in which we were required to utilize rudimentary building blocks to build an underwater scene.
# A2
Assignment A2 wanted us to further implement textures and conduct more complex movements of the character and camera in WebGL with HTML and Javascript.
# A3 
Assignment A3 had us developing a raytracer algorithm to develop GIMP images, I chose to utilize python.
# Future Ambition:
Even if it does not pertain to my future employment, I hope to further develop my skills in animation and graphics as it can assist with front end development. 
I hope to learn more about blending, shading and mesh processing for textures.
