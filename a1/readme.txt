Within A1 for CSC 305 I have fully implemented the following successfully:
Evaluation criteria # 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10

A cube scaled and translated such that it appears like the ground, in main.js lines: 272-283
2 Gray coloured rocks of different sizes, in main.js lines: 286 - 309
3 Seaweed strands each composed of 10 ellipses, in main.js lines: 501-536
Fish modelling, 2 eyes with pupils, 1 head, 1 body, 2 tail fins, in main.js lines: 407-500
Human character model with no arms which moves in x and y direction in world coordinates, in main.js lines: 310-404

I have partially implemented the following successfully:
Evaluation criteria #1, 5, 8, 12

Animations are synched to realtime(timestamp and dt), will not move until animation button is pressed.
However, figures jump positions when animation request sent due to change in time.
Seaweed experiences movement left and right uniformly but not at individual joints
Fish rotates in circular motion and rotates around fixed points.
However, does not swim due to inexperience with regard to joint movements for fin design.
There is a clear lack of understanding on my part with regard to realtime synchronization and joint rotations. 
Which is why i state evaluation objective 12 is partially implemented.I should have given myself way more time 
to complete this assignment and learn how to better move joints. 
However,I have been proccupied with other midterms and assignemnts.

I have not implemented the following:
Evaluation criteria #11
Due to limited knowledge on rotational movement around joints I was not able to complete 11.
